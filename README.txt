Since the last milestone we have made a lot of progress as a group. We have created working functionality for all areas of the website that interact with the backend, frontend, and each other! We also all worked on improving the aesthetics of our website design.

Individually, since the last milestone we have...

Flan: Created the review form for both seller and product reviews, allows users to edit and delete reviews they have written, display review information on the product page and individual user profile pages, only allow users to review products they have purchased/sellers they have purchased from.

Sarah: Created the seller inventory page, allow sellers to update their inventory and create new products for sale, implemented searching and filtering on the seller inventory page, allows sellers to see what people have ordered from them.

Jordan: Allow users to add items to cart, checkout those items (which involves decrementing user balance, incrementing seller balance, and decrementing quantity available of items purchased). Also moves items from cart to previous orders once they are checked out.

Sophie: Created individual product pages for each product that display the picture, price, seller, quantity, etc. Implemented searching and filtering for all products available for purchase. Created a stress test database with upwards of 1000 products to test the website design. 

Rhea: Finalized login and registration for new users to make sure that records were being updated in the database. Created functionality for editing profiles/balance. Allows reviewer information to be displayed with reviews and seller information to be displayed on the product page. Shows previous orders on the profile page along with total spent.
